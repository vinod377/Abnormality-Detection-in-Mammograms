# Abnormality-Detection-in-Mammograms
The repository contains the implementation of the research paper  [A Hybrid Computer-aided Diagnosis System for Abnormality Detection in Mammograms](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8256646).The author has done the analysis of algorithm on [MIAS DATASET](http://peipa.essex.ac.uk/info/mias.html).
In this c++ implementation [DDSM DATASET](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/CBIS-DDSM) is used.

#### In the .dcm to png converter code,DCMTKL and boost libraries are used.

**Note:The work is in progress and the repo will be updated frequently**
